## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a centralized, easy-to-access reference for Arduino library functions without needing to search through source code or online documentation. Each library reference includes:

- Function names and their complete syntax
- Clear descriptions of what each function does
- Practical code examples
- Important constants and enumerations
- Common usage patterns

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate to the library reference file you need
2. Search for the specific function or keyword
3. Review the syntax and parameters
4. Copy the example code and adapt it to your project

## 📖 File Format

Each library reference includes:
- **Keywords** - List of all syntax-highlighted terms
- **Functions** - Complete method signatures with parameters
- **Syntax** - How to properly call each function
- **Examples** - Working code snippets
- **Constants** - Predefined values and enumerations

## 🔧 Contributing

This is an ongoing project. More Arduino libraries will be added over time, including:
- Servo
- LiquidCrystal
- Wire (I2C)
- SPI
- SD Card
- Ethernet
- WiFi
- And many more...
